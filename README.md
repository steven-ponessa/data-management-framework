# IBM Consulting Workforce Management - Data Management Framework

The Workforce Management Data Management Framework is a robust and flexible data-driven API framework.  It allows backend relational data sources to be configured to provide RESTful CRUD operations to that data source.

---

## Overview

This framework offers a set of functionalities and tools that facilitate the configuration and management of backend relational data sources. It allows developers to define the schema, tables, and relationships of the data source in a structured manner, making it easy to map the data model to API endpoints.

Key characteristics of this API framework include:

1. **Configuration:** The framework provides a configuration layer where developers can define the relational data sources, tables, fields, and relationships. This configuration serves as the foundation for generating the RESTful CRUD operations.

2. **CRUD Operations:** The framework automatically generates a set of RESTful endpoints that correspond to the defined data model. These endpoints enable Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations (CRUD) on the underlying data sources. For example, developers can perform POST requests to create new records, GET requests to retrieve records, PUT/PATCH requests to update records, and DELETE requests to remove records.

3. **Data Validation:** The framework incorporates validation mechanisms to ensure data integrity and consistency. It may provide options to define validation rules for fields, such as data type checks, length restrictions, required fields, and custom validation logic.

4. **IDL and ETL Operations:** The framework automatically generates a set of API endpoints that enable **initial data loads** (full replace) or **extract, transformation, and loads** (delta change or append).

5. **Authorization and Authentication:** The framework supports authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure the API endpoints. It allows developers to enforce access control based on user roles, permissions, or other authentication mechanisms like OAuth or JWT.

6. **Querying and Filtering:** The framework often includes powerful querying and filtering capabilities to allow clients to retrieve data based on specific criteria. It may support query parameters like sorting, pagination, filtering, and complex search queries to efficiently retrieve the desired data.

7. **Relationships and Joins:** If the data model includes relationships between tables, the framework handles joins and associations to provide seamless access to related data. This allows clients to fetch data along with its associated entities in a single API call, avoiding multiple round trips to the server.

8. **Error Handling:** The framework provides standardized error responses and status codes to handle exceptions and errors during API requests. It ensures that clients receive meaningful error messages and appropriate HTTP status codes when encountering issues.

Overall, this API framework simplifies the process of exposing CRUD operations on backend relational data sources through a well-defined configuration layer. It abstracts the complexities of data access and provides a consistent and efficient way to interact with the data source via RESTful APIs.
