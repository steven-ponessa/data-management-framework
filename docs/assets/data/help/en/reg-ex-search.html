<p>A regular expression is a pattern describing a certain amount of text. It is matched against a subject string from left to right. Most characters stand for 
    themselves and match the corresponding characters in the subject text. The simplest form of regular expression is actual literal text. Mostly all analytical and 
    technology platforms support them, including Java, JavaScript, Node.js, Python, PHP, R, SQL, Tableau, LibreOffice, Scala, .NET, and Go. Additionally, nearly all text 
    editors, IDEs, and word processors also support searching files with regular expressions.  However, despite the ubiquity of regular expressions, they do not have a 
    steep learning curve.</p>
