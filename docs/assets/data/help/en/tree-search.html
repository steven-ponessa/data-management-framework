    The tree search is an interactive expandable/collapsible tree representing a complete taxonomy that can be searched for specific nodes.  It provides 3 ways for a user to search a tree:
</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>Basic</b> - Here a user may select one or many nodes from the dropdown control.
        <p>As taxonomy nodes are selected or removed, they are searched for and found in the tree. The d3 tree is then re-drawn with branches of non-found nodes collapsed and found nodes 
            expanded and the nodes, and arcs between the nodes, are highlighted in red.</p>
            <p>The selection dropdown allows for multiple nodes to be selected.  These selections are logically <b>OR</b>ed together upon selection with a "pillbox" for the selection 
            appearing within the search input box.  These nodes/pillboxes may be removed/closed by clicking on the 'x' at the right of the pillbox. To request a search where nodes are <b>AND</b>ed 
            together, use the <b>Advanced</b> or <b>Regular Expression</b> search tabs.</p>
    </li>
    <li><b>Advanced</b></li>
    <li><b>Regular Expression</b></li>
</ol>

<p>D3, short for Data Driven Documents, is a JavaScript-powered data visualization library that supports a myriad of
    features.
    The “Tree layout” is not a distinct type of diagram per se. Rather, it’s one type of D3’s family of hierarchical
    layouts.
    The tree layout produces a “node-link” diagram that lays out the connections among nodes in a way that displays the
    relationship of one node to another in a parent-child fashion.
</p>

<p>The tool takes the any taxonomy and builds a D3 tree, then exposes the first 2 levels of the taxonomy. Nodes that are collapsed (have non-displayed
    children) are represented with solid blue circles. Expanded nodes and leaf nodes are represented with
    non-solid blue circles (clear fill). Users may click on any node to
    expand or collapse the parent node, allowing them to explore the taxonomy in manageable chunks. The clear advantage
    to this style of diagram is that describing it in text or a single
    non-interactive image is difficult but representing it through an interactive graphic diagram makes the
    relationships easy to see and understand.
</p>

<p>Additionally, when hovering over any node in the tree, a text box displays additional information about that node.
    This is helpful when there are a lot of nodes simultaneously
    displayed and reading the content becomes difficult. </p>
