  This section describes how to define the API endpoint for APIs that will handle a data full replace (IDL - Initial Data Load) and a delta data update (ETL - Extract, Transformation, and Load). 
  Although an IDL and ETL can both be created with a single line of Java code each, this section looks at how the `AbstractDaoService` class processes IDL and ETL transactions.
