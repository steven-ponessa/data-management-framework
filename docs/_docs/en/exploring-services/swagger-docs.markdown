abstract: >- 
   The framework's Swagger UI allows API consumers to visualize and interact with the APIâ€™s resources without having any of the implementation logic in place. The framework automatically generates the OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger) Specification, with the visual documentation making it easy for back end implementation and client side consumption.
