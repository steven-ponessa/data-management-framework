  This project allows for the deployment of Java based microservices on the SpringBoot platform. Microservices are a modern approach to software whereby application 
  code is delivered in small, manageable pieces, independent of others. 
  Their small scale and relative isolation can lead to many additional benefits, such as easier maintenance, improved productivity, greater fault tolerance, better business alignment, and more.
