Welcome to the IBM Consulting Workforce Managment documentation project, aimed at standardizing product documentation through the use of GitHub Pages! 

This Documentation Tool is a website generation tool that creates static documentation websites and publishes them on GitHub pages. To get started, fork the tool from its GitHub repository ([https://github.ibm.com/IBM-Consulting-WFM/wfm-dmf-ga](https://github.ibm.com/IBM-Consulting-WFM/wfm-dmf-ga){:target="_blank"}) and follow the setup instructions provided in the repository's content. In the spirit of "eating your own dog food", these instructions are the content of the forked repository and are published on GitHub pages ([https://pages.github.ibm.com/IBM-Consulting-WFM/wfm-dmf-ga/](https://pages.github.ibm.com/IBM-Consulting-WFM/wfm-dmf-ga/){:target="_blank"}). They will guide you through the process of setting up the tool for your documentation needs. 

With The Documentation Tool, creating and publishing professional-looking documentation websites has never been easier!
