The JRS tree search is an interactive expandable/collapsible tree representing the full Job Role Specialty taxonomy:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Brand</li>
	<li>Growth Platform</li>
	<li>Service Line</li>
	<li>Practice</li>
	<li>Service Area</li>
	<li>Job Role Specialty (JRS)</li>
</ol>

<p>D3, short for Data Driven Documents, is a JavaScript-powered data visualization library that supports a myriad of features.
The “Tree layout” is not a distinct type of diagram per se. Rather, it’s one type of D3’s family of hierarchical layouts. 
The tree layout produces a “node-link” diagram that lays out the connections among nodes in a way that displays the relationship of one node to another in a parent-child fashion.
</p>

<p>The tool takes the full JRS taxonomy and builds a D3 tree, then exposes the first 2 levels of the taxonomy (Brand and Growth Platform). Nodes that are collapsed (have non-displayed
children) are represented with solid blue circles. Expanded nodes and leaf nodes (JRSs) are represented with non-solid blue circles (clear fill). Users may click on any node to
expand or collapse the parent node, allowing them to explore the taxonomy in manageable chunks.   The clear advantage to this style of diagram is that describing it in text or a single 
non-interactive image is difficult but representing it through an interactive graphic diagram makes the relationships easy to see and understand.

<p>Additionally, when hovering over any node in the tree, a text box displays additional information about that node. This is helpful when there are a lot of nodes simultaneously  
displayed and reading the content becomes difficult. </p>
