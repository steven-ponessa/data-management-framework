<p>The practitioner’s manager is responsible for changing the practitioner’s Primary JRS. It is incumbent upon managers to make sure that 
employee JRSs are current and accurate.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>The Primary JRS should describe the work performed by the practitioner.</li>
	<li>The Primary JRS must be a valid IBM Consulting JRS.</li>
	<li>The Primary JRS must be aligned to the Practice where the practitioner sits in the organization.</li>
	<li>In some instances, a practitioner's core expertise resides within Sector/Industry domains.  This is seen mainly in Business Sales & Delivery Executive, 
	Industry Consultant, Solution Consultant, or Solution Representative job roles.  The list of JRS/s applicable for these practitioners may be found in a 
	special category called <b>Sector/Industry-aligned JRSs</b>.</li>
	<li>With the corporate mandate to synchronize the way we categorize work between YC &amp; WFM tools and Workday, it is now important that practitioners are 
	assigned JRSs that are applicable to their Band.  In addition, practitioners in Sales roles that are eligible for incentive plans must be assigned JRSs 
	that are Incentive Eligible = Yes.  Incentive Eligible JRSs should not be used by Practitioners who are not on sales incentive plans.

	The JRS Navigator below will help you find the JRS that best describes the work that you or your employees do at IBM.  Use the filters to narrow the 
	search to those that are valid and applicable to your unit.</li>
