<p>Basic search comes in the form of filters for a multi-select box. Each option in the select box is a valid node within the Job Role/Specialty taxonomy.</p>
<p>The select box provides all the features of a standard select box with the addition of:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Grouping options by taxonomy level
		<ol>
			<li>Brand</li>
			<li>Growth Platform</li>
			<li>Service Line</li>
			<li>Practice</li>
			<li>Service Area</li>
			<li>Job Role Specialty (JRS)</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Type-ahead filtering. As the user types, options (taxonomy nodes) that do not contain the string entered are removed from the list of options.</li>
	<li>Once an option has been selected, it is removed from the list of available options within the group it belongs.</li>
</ul>
<p>As taxonomy nodes are selected or removed, they are searched for and found in the tree. The d3 tree is then re-drawn with branches of non-found nodes collapsed and found nodes 
expanded and the nodes, and arcs between the nodes, are highlighted in red.</p>
<p>The selection dropdown allows for multiple nodes to be selected.  These selections are logically <b>OR</b>ed together upon selection with a "pillbox" for the selection 
appearing within the search input box.  These nodes/pillboxes may be removed/closed by clicking on the 'x' at the right of the pillbox. To request a search where nodes are <b>AND</b>ed 
together, use the <b>Advanced</b> search tab.</p>
<p>By default, the tree is searched ignoring case and using a <b>pattern</b> match. Therefore, if the node selected was <em>SAP</em> it would find any node containing <em>SAP</em>, regardless
of case. To return only nodes that exactly match the node selected change the radio button selection to <b>Exact match</b>.</p>
